## Building from Source

To build the project from source, run:

yarn setup
yarn build
```

## Linting & Tests

To run linting and tests, use:

## Developer preview

To test your changes in a real environment, you can use the `dev` script. This will run the nextjs based preview server and watch for changes in the source code.

```bash

## Publishing

1. Open a pull request to the main repository
2. After the pull request is merged, a new version will be published. We bump the version, create a new tag and push it to the repository, then our pipeline will publish the new version to npm.
